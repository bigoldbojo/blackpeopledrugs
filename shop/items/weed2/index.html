                        This is our second weed. Now you gotta try out this weed. Whiteboy matty got sooo fuckin stoned the other night my drilla, you wouldn't comprehend my madman. His eyes were so red it looked like someone had taken a photo with the flash on my drilla. He got so smoked dude he was on some next level alien DMT shit. He's hit a whole new level my guy, like level 25 tetris fam. He's gone ahead and done it my drilla he got so fukin smoked he was talkin nonsense, like "is that tap talking to me???" Like no Matty that's an inanimate object. What an idiot. But then I look over at the tap, and this fucking tap is talking to us. It's on a mad one like "You finna catch this boof my drilla, I'm a tap and I'm talking to you right now my mucus." I look at Matty and I say "I think that tap is talking my mans" and he's like "Stop fucking with my Tyrone you can't fuck with me like that, how can the tap be talking" and I repeat what the tap said and Matty just gawks at me like "Bro that's what he told me, what the heck bro we must be on the same frequency or something." In conclusion this is good weed
